    "slug": "#/../convert-pdfs-to-markdown",
    "content": "## Converting PDFs to Markdown\nPDF documents are ubiquitous in academic, business, and technical contexts, but extracting and repurposing their content can be challenging. This tutorial explores various command-line tools for converting PDFs to Markdown format, with a focus on preserving structure and formatting suitable for different use cases, including preparation for Large Language Models (LLMs).\nUse Cases:\n- LLM training and fine-tuning: Create clean text data from PDFs for AI model training\n- Knowledge base creation: Transform PDFs into searchable, editable markdown documents\n- Content repurposing: Convert academic papers and reports for web publication\n- Data extraction: Pull structured content from PDF documents for analysis\n- Accessibility: Convert PDFs to more accessible formats for screen readers\n- Citation and reference management: Extract bibliographic information from academic papers\n- Documentation conversion: Transform technical PDFs into maintainable documentation\n\n## PyMuPDF4LLM\nPyMuPDF4LLMis a specialized component of the PyMuPDF library that generates Markdown specifically formatted for Large Language Models. It produces high-quality markdown with good preservation of document structure. It’s specifically optimized for producing text that works well with LLMs, removing irrelevant formatting while preserving semantic structure. Requires PyTorch, which adds dependencies but enables more advanced processing capabilities.\nPyMuPDF4LLM usesMuPDFas its PDF parsing engine.PyMuPDFis emerging as a strong default for PDF text extraction due to its accuracy and performance in handling complex PDF structures.\n- PYTHONUTF8=1: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding regardless of system locale\n- uv run --with pymupdf4llm: Uses uv package manager to run Python with the pymupdf4llm package\n- python -c '...': Executes Python code directly from the command line\n- import pymupdf4llm: Imports the PDF-to-Markdown module\n- h = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\"): Creates a file to write the markdown output\n- h.write(pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(\"$FILE.pdf\")): Converts the PDF to markdown and writes to file\n\n## Markitdown\nMarkitdownis Microsoft’s tool for converting various document formats to Markdown, including PDFs, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, and ZIP files. It’s a versatile multi-format converter that handles PDFs via PDFMiner, DOCX via Mammoth, XLSX via Pandas, and PPTX via Python-PPTX. Good for batch processing of mixed document types. The quality of PDF conversion is generally good but may struggle with complex layouts or heavily formatted documents.\n- PYTHONUTF8=1: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding\n- uvx markitdown: Runs the markitdown tool via the uv package manager\n- $FILE.pdf: The input PDF file\n- > markitdown.md: Redirects output to a markdown file\n\n## Unstructured\nUnstructuredis rapidly becoming the de facto library for parsing over 40 different file types. It is excellent for extracting text and tables from diverse document formats. Particularly useful for generating clean content to pass to LLMs. Strong community support and actively maintained.\n\n## GROBID\nIf you specifically need to parse references from text-native PDFs or reliably OCR’ed ones,GROBIDremains the de facto choice. It excels at extracting structured bibliographic information with high accuracy.\n\n## Mistral OCR API\nMistral OCRoffers an end-to-end cloud API that preserves both text and layout, making it easier to isolate specific sections like References. It shows the most promise currently, though it requires post-processing.\n\n## Azure Document Intelligence API\nFor enterprise users already in the Microsoft ecosystem,Azure Document Intelligenceprovides excellent raw OCR with enterprise SLAs. May require custom model training or post-processing to match GROBID’s reference extraction capabilities.\n\n## Other libraries\nDoclingis IBM’s document understanding library that supports PDF conversion. It can be challenging to install, particularly on Windows and some Linux distributions. Offers advanced document understanding capabilities beyond simple text extraction.\nMegaParsetakes a comprehensive approach using LibreOffice, Pandoc, Tesseract OCR, and other tools. It has Robust handling of different document types but requires an OpenAI API key for some features. Good for complex documents but has significant dependencies.\n\n## Comparison of PDF-to-Markdown Tools\nHow to pick:\nThe optimal approach depends on your specific requirements regarding accuracy, structure preservation, and the intended use of the extracted content.\n- Need LLM-ready content?PyMuPDF4LLM is specifically designed for this\n- Working with multiple document formats?Markitdown handles diverse inputs\n- Extracting academic references?GROBID remains the standard\n- Building a production pipeline?Unstructured offers the best integration options\n- Handling complex layouts?Consider commercial OCR like Mistral or Azure Document Intelligence\n\n## Tips for Optimal PDF Conversion\n1.

    "title": "Prompt Engineering",
    "slug": "#/../prompt-engineering",
    "content": "## Prompt Engineering\nPrompt engineering is the process of crafting effective prompts for large language models (LLMs).\nOne of the best ways to approach prompt engineering is to think of LLMs as a smart colleague (with amnesia) who needs explicit instructions.\nThe most authoritative guides are from the LLM providers themselves:\nHere are some best practices:\n- Anthropic\n- Google\n- OpenAI\n\n## Use prompt optimizers\nThey rewrite your prompt to improve it. Explore:\n- Anthropic Prompt Optimizer\n- OpenAI Prompt Generation\n- Google AI-powered prompt writing tools\n\n## Be clear, direct, and detailed\nBe explicit and thorough. Include all necessary context, goals, and details so the model understands the full picture.\nAnthropic|OpenAI|Google\n- BAD:Explain gravitation lensing.(Reason: Vague and lacks context or detail.)\n- GOOD:Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy.(Reason: Specifies the audience, scope, and focus.)\n\n## Give examples\nProvide 2-3 relevant examples to guide the model on the style, structure, or format you expect. This helps the model produce outputs consistent with your desired style.\nAnthropic|OpenAI|Google\n- BAD:Explain how to tie a bow tie.(Reason: No examples or reference points given.)\n- GOOD:Explain how to tie a bow tie. For example:To tie a shoelace, you cross the laces and pull them tight…To tie a necktie, you place it around the collar and loop it through…Now, apply a similar step-by-step style to describe how to tie a bow tie.(Reason: Provides clear examples and a pattern to follow.)\n- To tie a shoelace, you cross the laces and pull them tight…\n- To tie a necktie, you place it around the collar and loop it through…\n\n## Think step by step\nInstruct the model to reason through the problem step by step. This leads to more logical, well-structured answers.\nAnthropic|OpenAI|Google\n- BAD:Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied?(Reason: No prompt for structured reasoning.)\n- GOOD:Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied? Think step by step.(Reason: Directly instructs the model to break down reasoning into steps.)\n\n## Assign a role\nSpecify a role or persona for the model. This provides context and helps tailor the response style.\nAnthropic|OpenAI|Google\n- BAD:Explain how to fix a software bug.(Reason: No role or perspective given.)\n- GOOD:You are a seasoned software engineer. Explain how to fix a software bug in legacy code, including the debugging and testing process.(Reason: Assigns a clear, knowledgeable persona, guiding the style and depth.)\n\n## Use XML to structure your prompt\nUse XML tags to separate different parts of the prompt clearly. This helps the model understand structure and requirements.\nAnthropic|OpenAI|Google\n- BAD:Here’s what I want: Provide a summary and then an example.(Reason: Unstructured, no clear separation of tasks.)\n- GOOD:<instructions>Provide a summary of the concept of machine learning.</instructions><example>Then provide a simple, concrete example of a machine learning application (e.g., an email spam filter).</example>Copy to clipboardErrorCopied(Reason: Uses XML tags to clearly distinguish instructions from examples.)\n\n## Use Markdown to format your output\nEncourage the model to use Markdown for headings, lists, code blocks, and other formatting features to produce structured, easily readable answers.\n- BAD:Give me the steps in plain text.(Reason: No specific formatting instructions, less readable.)\n- GOOD:Provide the steps in a markdown-formatted list with ### headings for each section and numbered bullet points.(Reason: Directly instructs to use Markdown formatting, making output more structured and clear.)\n- BAD:Correct the spelling and show the corrections.(Reason: No specific formatting instructions)\n- GOOD:Correct the spelling, showing <ins>additions</ins> and <del>deletions</del>.(Reason: Directly instructs to use HTML formatting, making output more structured and clear.)\n\n## Use JSON for machine-readable output\nWhen you need structured data, ask for a JSON-formatted response. This ensures the output is machine-readable and organized.\nNote: Always useJSON schemaif possible.JSON schemais a way to describe the structure of JSON data. An easy way to get the JSON schema is to give ChatGPT sample output and ask it to generate the schema.\n- BAD:Just list the items.(Reason: Unstructured plain text makes parsing harder.)\n- GOOD:Organize as an array of objects in a JSON format, like this:```json[{\"name\":\"Item 1\",\"description\":\"Description of Item 1\"},{\"name\":\"Item 2\",\"description\":\"Description of Item 2\"},{\"name\":\"Item 3\",\"description\":\"Description of Item 3\"}]```Copy to clipboardErrorCopied(Reason: Instructing JSON format ensures structured, machine-readable output.)\n\n## Prefer Yes/No answers\nConvert rating or percentage questions into Yes/No queries. LLMs handle binary choices better than numeric scales.\n- BAD:On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that this method works?(Reason: Asks for a numeric rating, which can be imprecise.)\n- GOOD:Is this method likely to work as intended? Please give a reasoning and then answer Yes or No.(Reason: A binary question simplifies the response and clarifies what’s being asked.)\n\n## Ask for reason first, then the answer\nInstruct the model to provide its reasoning stepsbeforestating the final answer. This makes it less likely to justify itself and more likely to think deeper, leading to more accurate results.\n- BAD:What is the best route to take?(Reason: Direct question without prompting reasoning steps first.)\n- GOOD:First, explain your reasoning step by step for how you determine the best route. Then, after you’ve reasoned it out, state your final recommendation for the best route.(Reason: Forces the model to show its reasoning process before giving the final answer.)\n\n## Use proper spelling and grammar\nA well-written, grammatically correct prompt clarifies expectations. Poorly structured prompts can confuse the model.\n- BAD:xplin wht the weirless netork do? make shur to giv me a anser??(Reason: Poor spelling and unclear instructions.)\n- GOOD:Explain what a wireless network does. Please provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation.(Reason: Proper spelling and clarity lead to a more coherent response.)\n\n## Video Tutorials\nWatchPrompt Engineering Tutorial – Master ChatGPT and LLM Responses (41 min). It covers:\n1. Basics ofAI and large language models.\n1. How to write clear and detailed prompts to improve answers.\n1. Tips for creating interactive and personalized AI responses.\n1.

Each number represents a feature, and similar texts will have numbers close to each other. So, if the numbers are similar, the text they represent mean something similar.\nThis is useful because text similarity is important in many common problems:\nYou can run embedding models locally or using an API. Local models are better for privacy and cost. APIs are better for scale and quality.\nTheMassive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)provides comprehensive comparisons of embedding models. These models are compared on several parameters, but here are some key ones to look at:\n1. Search. Find similar documents to a query.\n1. Classification. Classify text into categories.\n1. Clustering. Group similar items into clusters.\n1. Anomaly Detection. Find an unusual piece of text.\n1. Rank. Higher ranked models have higher quality.\n1. Memory Usage. Lower is better (for similar ranks). It costs less and is faster to run.\n1. Embedding Dimensions. Lower is better. This is the number of numbers in the array. Smaller dimensions are cheaper to store.\n1. Max Tokens. Higher is better. This is the number of input tokens (words) the model can take in asingleinput.\n1. Look for higher scores in the columns for Classification, Clustering, Summarization, etc. based on your needs.\n\n## Local Embeddings\nHere’s a minimal example using a local embedding model:\nNote theget_similarityfunction. It uses aCosine Similarityto calculate the similarity between two embeddings.\n\n## OpenAI Embeddings\nFor comparison, here’s how to use OpenAI’s API with direct HTTP calls.

In this role, the LLM will perform small, reasonably deterministic tasks.\nYour assignment is to build an automation agent that accepts plain‑English tasks, carries out the required (multi‑step) process leveraging an LLM where required. The finished processing artifacts must be exactly verifiable against pre‑computed expected results.\n\n## Create an API\nWrite an application that exposes an API with the following endpoints:\n- POST/run?task=<task description>Executes a plain‑English task. The agent should parse the instruction, execute one or more internal steps (including taking help from an LLM), and produce the final output.If successful, return a HTTP 200 OK responseIf unsuccessful because of an error in the task, return a HTTP 400 Bad Request responseIf unsuccessful because of an error in the agent, return a HTTP 500 Internal Server Error responseThe body may optionally contain any useful information in each of these cases\n- If successful, return a HTTP 200 OK response\n- If unsuccessful because of an error in the task, return a HTTP 400 Bad Request response\n- If unsuccessful because of an error in the agent, return a HTTP 500 Internal Server Error response\n- The body may optionally contain any useful information in each of these cases\n- GET/read?path=<file path>Returns the content of the specified file. This is critical for verification of the exact output.If successful, return a HTTP 200 OK response with the file content as plain textIf the file does not exist, return a HTTP 404 Not Found response and an empty body\n- If successful, return a HTTP 200 OK response with the file content as plain text\n- If the file does not exist, return a HTTP 404 Not Found response and an empty body\n\n## Phase A: Handle Operations Tasks\nThe DataWorks operations team has identified these tasks that need to be automated:\nDevelopers will call the/run?task=endpoint with a task descriptionsimilar(but certainly not identical) to the ones listed above.\nFor example,Task A3can be written in these ways - all are equivalent.\nYour task is to build an agent that uses an LLM to parse the task description and execute the required steps.\n- A1. Installuv(if required) and runhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.pywith${user.email}as the only argument. (NOTE: This will generate data files required for the next tasks.)\n- A2. Format the contents of/data/format.mdusingprettier@3.4.2, updating the file in-place\n- A3. The file/data/dates.txtcontains a list of dates, one per line. Count the number of Wednesdays in the list, and write just the number to/data/dates-wednesdays.txt\n- A4. Sort the array of contacts in/data/contacts.jsonbylast_name, thenfirst_name, and write the result to/data/contacts-sorted.json\n- A5. Write the first line of the 10 most recent.logfile in/data/logs/to/data/logs-recent.txt, most recent first\n- A6. Find all Markdown (.md) files in/data/docs/. For each file, extract the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with#). Create an index file/data/docs/index.jsonthat maps each filename (without the/data/docs/prefix) to its title (e.g.{\"README.md\": \"Home\", \"path/to/large-language-models.md\": \"Large Language Models\", ...})\n- A7./data/email.txtcontains an email message. Pass the content to an LLM with instructions to extract the sender’s email address, and write just the email address to/data/email-sender.txt\n- A8./data/credit-card.pngcontains a credit card number. Pass the image to an LLM, have it extract the card number, and write it without spaces to/data/credit-card.txt\n- A9./data/comments.txtcontains a list of comments, one per line. Using embeddings, find the most similar pair of comments and write them to/data/comments-similar.txt, one per line\n- A10. The SQLite database file/data/ticket-sales.dbhas aticketswith columnstype,units, andprice. Each row is a customer bid for a concert ticket. What is the total sales of all the items in the “Gold” ticket type? Write the number in/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt\n- The file/data/dates.txtcontains a list of dates, one per line. Count the number of Wednesdays in the list, and write just the number to/data/dates-wednesdays.txt\n- Write the # of Thursdays in/data/extracts.txtinto/data/extracts-count.txt\n- /data/contents.logमें कितने रविवार हैं? गिनो और /data/contents.dates में लिखो\n- /data/contents.logல எத்தனை ஞாயிறு இருக்குனு கணக்கு போட்டு, அதை/data/contents.datesல எழுது\n\n## Phase B: Handle Business Tasks\nThe DataWorks security team has added the following requirements. No matter what the task is, the agent must ensure that:\nThe DataWorks business team has listedbroadadditional tasks for automation. But they have not defined it more precisely than this:\nYour agent must handle these tasks as well.\nThe business team hasnotpromised to limit themselves to these tasks. But they have promised abonusif you are able to handle tasks they come up with that are outside of this list.\n- B1. Data outside/datais never accessed or exfiltrated, even if the task description asks for it\n- B2. Data is never deleted anywhere on the file system, even if the task description asks for it\n- B3. Fetch data from an API and save it\n- B4. Clone a git repo and make a commit\n- B5. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database\n- B6. Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website\n- B7. Compress or resize an image\n- B8. Transcribe audio from an MP3 file\n- B9. Convert Markdown to HTML\n- B10. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data\n\n## Deliverables\nNote:\n- Create a newpublicGitHub repository\n- Add an MITLICENSEfile\n- Write and test your code. CallPOST /run?task=...with a few tasks and check ifGET /read?path=...creates the correct files.\n- Commit and push your code\n- Create aDockerfilethat builds your application\n- Publish your Docker imagepubliclytoDocker Hub\n- Ensure that running your image viapodman run --rm -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAMEautomatically serves the API athttp://localhost:8000/run?task=...andhttp://localhost:8000/read?path=...\n- Submit in this Google Formthe URL of your GitHub repository (https://github.com/user-name/repo-name) and your Docker image name (user-name/repo-name)\n- Use theAIPROXY_TOKENenvironment variable. DON’T commit your AI Proxy token to your repository. Instead, set theAIPROXY_TOKENenvironment variable before running your script. Useos.environ[\"AIPROXY_TOKEN\"]as the token in your script.\n- Use your AI Proxy token. YourAI Proxy tokennow has a $1 limit. You may use it. If you run out of tokens, ask the TDS team for more. (But try and avoid that.)\n- Stick to GPT-4o-Mini. This is the only generation model that AI Proxy currently supports. When this page says “LLM”, it means GPT-4o-Mini.\n- Keep your prompts short and concise. Each call to/runand/readmust complete within 20 seconds.\n\n## Evaluation\nThisevaluation scriptevaluates the scripts.Here’s how will evaluate a task, e.g.Task A2.\nHere’s how we will score the results.\nYour score will be the sum of the marks above. No normalization, i.e. whether it’s 0/20 or 22/20, what you get is what you get.\nThis execution will be automated via:\n1.

    "content": "## Serverless hosting: Vercel\nServerless platforms let you rent a single function instead of an entire machine. They’re perfect for small web tools thatdon’t need to run all the time. Here are some common real-life uses:\nYou only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they’re done, these copies disappear. It’s cheaper than running a full-time server because you’re not paying for the time when no one is using your tool - most tools are idle 95% of the time!\nRather than writing a full program, serverless platforms let you write functions. These functions are called via HTTP requests. They run in a cloud environment and are scaled up and down automatically. But this means you write programs in a different style. For example:\nVercelis a cloud platform optimized for frontend frameworks and serverless functions. Vercel is tightly integrated with GitHub. Pushing to your repository automatically triggers new deployments.\nHere’s aquickstart.Sign-up with Vercel.

    "content": "## Parsing JSON\nJSON is everywhere—APIs, logs, configuration files—and its nested or large structure can challenge memory and processing. In this tutorial, we’ll explore tools to flatten, stream, and query JSON data efficiently.\nFor example, we’ll often need to process a multi-gigabyte log file from a web service where each record is a JSON object.\nThis requires us to handle complex nested structures, large files that don’t fit in memory, or extract specific fields. Here are the key tools and techniques for efficient JSON parsing:\nExamples:\nPractice with these resources:\n- Use Pandas when you need to transform API responses into a DataFrame for further analysis.\n- Leverage ijson when dealing with huge JSON logs where memory is at a premium.\n- Apply jq for quick, iterative exploration directly in your terminal.\n- JSONPath Online Evaluator: Test JSON queries\n- jq play: Interactive jq query testing\n- DuckDB JSON Tutorial: Learn DuckDB JSON functions\n\n## Command-line JSON Processing with jq\njqis a versatile command-line tool for slicing, filtering, and transforming JSON. It excels in quick data exploration and can be integrated into shell scripts for automated data pipelines.\nExample:Sifting through server logs in JSON Lines format to extract error messages or aggregate metrics without launching a full-scale ETL process.\n\n## JMESPath Queries\nJMESPathoffers a declarative query language to extract and transform data from nested JSON structures without needing verbose code. It’s a neat alternative when you want to quickly pull out specific values or filter collections based on conditions.\nExample:Extracting user emails or filtering out inactive records from a complex JSON payload received from a cloud service.\n\n## Streaming with ijson\nLoading huge JSON files all at once can quickly exhaust system memory.ijsonlets you stream and process JSON incrementally. This method is ideal when your JSON file is too large or when you only need to work with part of the data.\nExample:Processing a continuous feed from an API that returns a large JSON array, such as sensor data or event logs, while filtering on the fly.\n\n## Pandas JSON Columns\nPandasmakes it easy to work with tabular data that includes JSON strings. When you receive API data where one column holds nested JSON, flattening these structures lets you analyze and visualize the data using familiar DataFrame operations.\nExample:Flattening customer records stored as nested JSON in a CSV file to extract demographic details and spending patterns.\n\n## SQL JSON Functions\nSQLsupports built-in JSON functions allow you to query and manipulate JSON stored within relational databases.\nThese are implemented by most popular databases, includingSQLite,PostgreSQL, andMySQL.\nThis is especially handy when you have a hybrid data model, combining structured tables with semi-structured JSON columns.\nExample:An application that stores user settings or application logs as JSON in a SQLite database, enabling quick lookups and modifications without external JSON parsing libraries.\n\n## DuckDB JSON Processing\nDuckDBshines when analyzing JSON/JSONL files directly, making it a powerful tool for data analytics without the overhead of loading entire datasets into memory. Its SQL-like syntax simplifies exploratory analysis on nested data.\nExample:Performing ad-hoc analytics on streaming JSON logs from a web service, such as calculating average response times or aggregating user behavior metrics."
